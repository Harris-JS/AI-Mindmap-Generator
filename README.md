## 🧩 Example  
<br></br>

_The Renaissance, spanning roughly the 14th to the 16th centuries, was an era defined by a dramatic shift in intellectual focus, moving from the God-centered worldview of the Middle Ages to the anthropocentric (human-centered) philosophy of Humanism. This pivotal movement sought to recover, study, and apply the literature, art, and philosophy of classical antiquity, particularly Greek and Roman culture, not merely for religious context but for their inherent value in understanding the human experience. Central to Humanism was the belief in the dignity and potential of the individual, fostering an intense curiosity that fueled advancements in art, science, and governance. Thinkers like Petrarch championed the studia humanitatis (studies of humanity), emphasizing grammar, rhetoric, history, poetry, and moral philosophy—subjects considered essential for cultivating a virtuous and engaged citizenry. This intellectual rebirth laid the foundational groundwork for the Enlightenment and remains a profound example of how rediscovering past wisdom can radically reshape present and future civilization._
